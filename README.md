# Interconnect Fabrics:

This repository contains implementations for various SoC fabric protocols:

1. AMBA - AXI4        (Advanced eXtensible Interface)
2. AMBA - AXI4-Lite   (Advanced eXtensible Interface - Lite)
2. AMBA - APB         (Advanced Peripheral Bus)

Bridges:

1. AXI4       to APB
2. AXI4-Lite  to APB
3. AXI4       to AXI4-Lite
